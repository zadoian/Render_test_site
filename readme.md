# Flask Category Selector with Logger

This is a simple Flask web application with a logging feature that tracks the user's interactions with the API and logs it to a file. The project also includes a basic frontend where users can select a category, and the selection is logged by the backend.

## Features
- **Flask API**:
  - Provides a list of categories.
  - Allows the user to select a category via a POST request.
  - Logs API requests and user interactions (selected categories) to a `flask_app.log` file.

- **Frontend**:
  - Displays categories fetched from the Flask API.
  - Allows users to select a category.
  - Displays a notification (using Toastify) when a category is selected.

├── app.py                 # The main Flask backend application
├── flask_app.log          # Log file generated by the Flask application
├── index.html             # Frontend for selecting categories and displaying toast notifications
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies for the project

```

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project to your local machine.

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**:
   Open `index.html` in your browser.

6. **Test the application**:
   - The application provides a list of categories fetched from the backend.
   - When a user selects a category, a `POST` request is made to the backend, and a Toast notification appears.

## Logging
All API requests and user interactions are logged in `flask_app.log` in the following format:
```
2024-09-12 12:00:01,123 - INFO - Client selected category ID: 1, Description: Meat
```

## Dependencies

- **Flask** - A micro web framework for Python.
- **Flask-CORS** - Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for the Flask app.
- **Toastify** - A lightweight library for displaying toast notifications in the frontend.
- **Axios** - A promise-based HTTP client used in the frontend to interact with the Flask API.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /categories`
- Returns a list of available categories in JSON format.

### `POST /select_category`
- Accepts a category ID and returns the selected category details.

## Example Logs
Example of logged data in the `flask_app.log`:
